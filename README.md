# FF14-class-picker

This is for a game I am play called final fantasy 14 - The games has classes that can go up to level 90 so I thought a command line randomizer would be a good way to pick which class I want to level. 

I have added options in case someone wants to focus on Tanking, healing or DPS.

New changes

Since Final fantasy 14 endwalker brought two new classes to the game (Reaper, sage) I will be adding them to the correct groups they should be in.
